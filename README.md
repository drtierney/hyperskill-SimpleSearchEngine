# hyperskill-SimpleSearchEngine
Developing a simple search engine to see if a query exists (or not) within a data set. https://hyperskill.org/projects/66

**Stage #1 String theory**
Set two strings (where to search and what to search) for the program to return an index of the searched word or report “not found”.

**Stage #2 Expand the search**
With the help of arrays and linear search, add more strings to the program and search for specific data from that input. 

**Stage #3 User menu**
Using switch operator and methods, create a user menu for your search engine.

**Stage #4 X-files**
Enable your search engine to search for data stored in the files.

**Stage #5 Inverted index search**
Working with lists and maps, build the inverted index to enhance your search.

**Stage #6 Search strategies**
Get familiar with patterns and learn to deal with more complex types of search.
